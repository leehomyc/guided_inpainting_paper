\section{More Results}

We show more results on 256x256 images with random holes and compare with GLI. We also show more 512x512 results with random holes. We then show more face results. Finally, we show more harmoinzation (and compare with deep image harmonization) and interactive guided inpainting result. All results are randomly sampled from test set.
