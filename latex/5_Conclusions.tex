\section{Conclusions}
We propose a novel model and training scheme to address the inpainting problem and achieve excellent performance on several tasks, including general inpainting, image harmonization and guided inpainting. Although we only explore the ability of our approach in image editing related tasks, we believe it is a general methodology that could be easily applied to other generative problems, such as image translation, image synthesis, etc. As future work, we plan to study the effectiveness of the proposed network and losses, and especially the procedural training scheme on a larger scope.
